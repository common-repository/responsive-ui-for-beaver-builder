== Description ==

When you have set Visibility settings in Beaver Builder, it's not easy to see what rows, columns and modules appear on different devices. This plugin adds a visual guide with a click of a button.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work =

Beaver Builder lets you hide and show elements based on "Visibility" settings dependent on device size. You can control these via the 'Advanced' tab in row, column and module settings in the 'Visibility' section. Which is great, but the only problem is you can't then see which elements are hiding and showing until you click on each of their settings.

In order to see which modules, columns and rows are showing/hiding, edit any page with Beaver Builder and you will see the "UI" button appear in the top bar. Click on that to see which elements you have with Visibility settings and which devices they are set to.

== Screenshots ==
